## Welcome to my silly tower defense game


### TODO LIST:


Game wise:

1. add money into the game
2. make it so you cannot stack tower on top or super close
3. add different turret types
4. add Menu
5. Calculate scores


Code wise:

1. add pre-commit with black, flake8, mypy
2. add type hints
3. refactor code into smaller chunks
